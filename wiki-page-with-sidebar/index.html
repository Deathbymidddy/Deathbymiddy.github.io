                    Beyblade (ベイブレード, Beiburēdo, diminutive Bey, from the 
                    diminutive of beigoma) is a line of spinning-top toys 
                    originally developed by Takara, first released in Japan in 
                    July 1999, along with its debut series. Following Takara's 
                    merger with Tomy in 2006, Beyblades are now developed by 
                    Takara Tomy. Various toy companies around the world have 
                    licensed Beyblade toys for their own regions, 
                    including Hasbro in Western countries,
                    Sonokong in South Korea, and Takara Tomy for most 
                    Eastern countries.Both the toys and their names were 
                    inspired by the beigoma, a traditional Japanese spinning 
                    top. The concept is similar to Battling Tops, another 
                    spinning top game developed in 1968. The toy line was 
                    introduced with an accompanying manga series of the same 
                    name in 1999. In 2002, Hasbro began to sell Beyblade toys 
                    internationally (under license from Takara) 
                    along with a coordinated country-by-country 
                    release of localized versions of the TV series. 
                    On July 12, 2008, Takara Tomy released Metal Fight: 
                    Beyblade, the second iteration of the toy. The third 
                    iteration, titled Beyblade Burst, was released by Takara 
                    Tomy on July 18, 2015. The fourth iteration of the toyline, 
                    Beyblade X, was released on July 15, 2023.

                <p>
                    Aside from informal play, a game with specific rules was 
                    published for the initial toy line. The guidelines may 
                    undergo occasional modifications based on the specific 
                    circumstances and the individuals participating. 
                    In the official competition, a minimum of two players 
                    engage in the game. Each participant is permitted a maximum 
                    of three Beyblades; however, it's important to note that 
                    once a match commences, swapping out parts is strictly 
                    prohibited. For each battle within a match, players retain 
                    the flexibility to select any of their three available 
                    Beyblades.In Metal Fight Beyblade, a points system was 
                    introduced. In the Beyblade Burst line of toys, 
                    Hasbro releases its own rule-set for its toy line. 
                    In general, the first player to 3 points will win a match.
                    [1]Players receive points based on the appearance of their 
                    Beyblade, as the names of certain Beyblades can differ 
                    depending on the region. The scoring system takes into 
                    account both Hasbro and Takara Tomy terminologies, 
                    with points awarded accordingly. The Beyblade's visual 
                    appeal becomes a key factor in determining the player's 
                    score, as the Hasbro terminology is followed by the Takara 
                    Tomy names. This ensures a fair evaluation, 
                    considering the regional variations in Beyblade names. 
                    The scoring process reflects the diverse naming conventions 
                    used by both Hasbro and Takara Tomy, enhancing the overall 
                    fairness and inclusivity of the competition. In essence, 
                    the evaluation system accommodates the unique c
                    haracteristics of Beyblades from different regions.
                    One point is awarded if the opponent's Beyblade stops 
                    spinning (Sleep Out/Survivor/Spin Finish).
                    One point is awarded if the opponent's Beyblade is knocked 
                    out of the stadium or falls into a pocket in the stadium 
                    (Stadium Out/Ring Out/Over Finish/KO/Knockout Finish).
                    Beginning with Beyblade Burst, two points are awarded if 
                    the opponent's top disassembles is "burst" during a battle
                    (Crash Out/Burst Finish).
                    Beginning with Beyblade X, Over Finishes count for two 
                    points, and three points are awarded if the opponent's top 
                    is knocked through the Xtreme Pocket in the special 
                    Xtreme Stadium (Xtreme Finish).
                    In the event of a draw (both Beyblades exited the ring 
                    simultaneously and get stuck there, stop spinning 
                    simultaneously, or burst at the same time), 
                    no points are awarded to either player. 
                    The stadium's pockets and entrance are sometimes referred 
                    to as "extended play area" as opposed to "primary play area" 
                    since if a Beyblade gets into one of the pockets but is able
                    to escape, it will not count as a knockout. 
                    For the stadium's entrance, if a Beyblade flies there, gets 
                    caught there and goes around the stadium but doesn't fall 
                    out of the stadium, it will also not be counted as a 
                    knockout

                    There are four main types of Beyblades. There are Defense 
                    types, Attack types, Stamina types, and Balance types. T
                    he first three of those types have rock-paper-scissors style 
                    effectiveness, with Defense generally supposed to be 
                    effective against Attack, Attack against Stamina, and 
                    Stamina against Defense. However, due to the high 
                    variability of the custom designs, especially in the metal 
                    series, this is not a hard rule. Balance types may be strong 
                    or weak to any of the others depending on specific parts. 
                    However, they generally don't exceed in any aspect.
                <h4>Attack</h4>
                    Attack Beyblades are great at in attacking other Beyblades. 
                    They are used to knock out other Beyblade, or in the case 
                    of the burst series, burst the other Beyblades at the cost 
                    of having poor stamina. They tend to outperform Stamina 
                    Beyblades, which have a lack of defense. 
                    Attack Beyblades are heavy as to be able to knock others out
                    . They usually have flat or rubber performance tips and have 
                    layers that can grip the opponent.
                <h4>Defense</h4>
                    Defense Beyblades are used to withstand attacks. 
                    They tend to travel slowly and are heavier than other types,
                    resulting in opponents being deflected. Their weight also 
                    causes them to launch slower, resulting in less stamina. 
                    They tend to wear down Attack-types but are outlasted by 
                    Stamina. They tend to be made of thicker metals and have 
                    wide ball-like performance tips.
                <h4>Stamina</h4>
                    Stamina Beyblades attempt to outlast opposing Beyblades. 
                    They are used to out-spin the enemy Beyblade. In exchange 
                    for a lack of power, they can outlast other types of 
                    Beyblades, making them naturally advantageous over 
                    Defense-Types, which focus on resisting hits. 
                    They have sharp cone-shaped performance tips.
                <h4>Balance</h4>
                    Balance Beyblades specialize in a combination of the other
                    three types listed above, giving them no glaring strengths 
                    or weaknesses. Regardless of their strength, they combine
                    Attack, Defense, and Stamina Beyblades but do not excel at
                    any of them. Some Balance Beyblades have Attack, Defense,
                    and Stamina Modes, and their performance tips can vary.

                    An arena called a Beystadium is sold by both brands Takara 
                    Tomy and Hasbro. It is shaped like a shallow plastic bowl 
                    but may have other features dependent on the purpose of the 
                    particular stadium. Different stadiums were released in 
                    different markets. Brands Takara Tomy and Sonokong produce 
                    Beystadiums similar to those featured in the manga and anime 
                    adaptations, with open sections in the walls and openings 
                    on the sides to launch into. Hasbro produces stadiums with 
                    walls that are about 3.7 in (94 mm) tall and pockets that 
                    count as a ring-out instead. Common features of a Beystadium 
                    include a circular shallow impression where the edge is 
                    called the tornado ridge, which allows Attack type Beyblades 
                    to move around quickly without accidentally knocking 
                    themselves out, and cyclone/tornado’s points, which are 
                    recessed disks in the stadium floor that spin freely to 
                    add randomness to a battle. Other features may be specific 
                    to the series that the Beystadium is released in, like the 
                    rails from the Beyblade Burst Slingshock toy system, the 
                    large, almost bowl-like HyperSphere toy system, the 
                    noticeably taller Speedstorm toy system, and QuadDrive 
                    toy system, which features a Low Mode and High Mode not 
                    unlike its Takara Tomy counterpart along with a detachable, 
                    separate Armor tip on the driver, and the similar QuadStrike 
                    toy system, the Armor Tips and Stadiums of which are similar 
                    to drivers from the HyperSphere system. The metal series 
                    stadiums also have a "secondary slope", which is a small 
                    area about two centimeters thick that isn't a curve that 
                    exists between the tornado ridge and the centre of the 
                    stadium and is right next to the tornado ridge. The 
                    secondary slope allows Attack Beyblades to perform a 
                    circular pattern that goes through the centre of the stadium 
                    as opposed to circling around the Beyblade in the middle 
                    that allows them to knock the Stamina Beyblade that stays 
                    in the middle out easier. This pattern is called the 
                    "flower pattern" since the path of the Beyblade resembles 
                    a flower.

                <h3 id="Launching">Launching</h3>
                <p>
                    A Beyblade Launcher (often referred to as a BeyLauncher) is 
                    used to launch the user's Beyblade into battle. 
                    Select launchers have different levels of power depending 
                    on the gears inside of them and the user's own launch 
                    strength. Launchers differ in size and shape, with some of 
                    them using Ripcords (long sticks of plastic with grips on 
                    the end and teeth on the sides to strike the gears of the 
                    launcher that launches the user's Beyblade when pulled) and 
                    others using Strings (long strings with grips on the end 
                    that are connected to a gear that has a retracting mechanism 
                    that strikes the gears of the launcher that launches the 
                    user's Beyblade with slightly more power when pulled). 
                    String Launchers are preferred by most players because of 
                    their launch power. Different series such as 2000/Original, 
                    Metal Fight/Fusion, and Burst launchers cannot be used with 
                    others. Launching is often accompanied by a catchphrase. 
                    In the Takara Tomy version, this would be 
                    "3, 2, 1, Go Shoot!" (3、2、1、ゴーシュート!); in the Hasbro 
                    version, this would be "3, 2, 1, Let it Rip!"[1]
