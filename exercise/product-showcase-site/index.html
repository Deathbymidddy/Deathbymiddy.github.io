                        Takara Tomy Fang Leone Beyblade (BB-106) 
                        - Includes Right Spin Beyblade Launcher. 
                        The Fang Leone 130W2D Beyblade is a defense style bey, 
                        but it also has respectable amount of attack power and 
                        stamina as well. However, defense is definitely Fang's 
                        strong point - because of how symmetrical 
                        (and near perfectly round) the shape of it is. Also, 
                        Fang Leone weighs 47 grams - which gives it a weight 
                        advantage of many of the other Metal Fury Beyblades.
