            <li>2 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            Place butter in a light colored saucepan over medium heat. Cook, 
            stirring often, until butter has browned and begins to smell nutty, 
            7 to 10 minutes. Measure out 1/2 cup browned butter and pour into a 
            large mixing bowl to cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            Reserve remaining browned butter (1/4 to 1/3 cup) for the filling.
            Stir brown sugar and corn syrup into the bowl with cooled brown 
            butter until thoroughly combined; stir in egg and 2 teaspoons 
            vanilla. Add in oats, flour, cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon salt, nutmeg, 
            baking soda, baking powder, cloves, and allspice and stir until 
            combined.Scoop out 2 tablespoons of dough and carefully roll into a 
            ball. Repeat with remaining dough. Place dough balls into the fridge 
            to chill for about 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
            (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or 
            parchment paper.Place chilled balls of dough about 3 inches apart on
            the prepared baking sheets (about 6 dough balls per pan). 
            Bake one pan at a time until cookies begin to turn golden brown on 
            the edges, 10 to 11 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet 
            for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
            To make filling, place cream cheese into a large bowl and beat with 
            a mixer until soft and smooth. Beat in reserved 1/4 to 1/3 cup brown b
            butter. Beat in 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla, 
            then beat in 1 cup powdered sugar. Beat in remaining 1 1/2 cups 
            powdered sugar as needed to make a smooth, spreadable filling. 
            Place filling into a piping bag and snip off the end. Keep filling 
            refrigerated until ready to use.When ready to fill cookies, match 
            up two cookies of somewhat even shape and size. 
            Lay one cookie top-side down and pipe about 1/4 cup filling onto 
            the cookie. Top with matching cookie and press down until filling 
            almost reaches the edges of the cookies. Repeat with remaining 
            ingredients. Store finished cookies in the refrigerator.

            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            Make frosting: Place dark chocolate chips in a large bowl; set aside
            . Combine 1 1/2 cups white sugar, water, and corn syrup in a light 
            colored, tall-sided saucepan. Place pan over medium heat and cook 
            until mixture begins to turn a deep amber color, swirling pan often 
            to combine ingredients; about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and 
            carefully pour in heavy cream (mixture will bubble up rapidly and 
            then seize, this is ok). Place pan back over low heat and bring to a 
            boil, stirring constantly. Allow mixture to boil for 5 minutes, 
            stirring constantly, then immediately pour caramel over the 
            chocolate chips. Allow mixture to stand for 1 minute.Gently stir 
            until chocolate is melted and smooth. Add in 2 teaspoons vanilla and 
            Irish Cream and mix until combined. Add in butter 1 tablespoon at a 
            time, making sure each addition is fully incorporated before adding 
            the next, until all 3 tablespoons of butter are incorporated. 
            Loosely cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set aside to cool to 
            room temperature, stirring occasionally 
            (this will take 4 to 6 hours).Combine stout beer and 1 tablespoon 
            dark brown sugar in a saucepan set over medium heat. 
            Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, 
            until mixture has reduced to 1 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature, 
            about 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease and flour 2 (9-inch) round cake pans. Sift together flour, 
            cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt;
            set dry ingredients aside.Beat 1/2 cup unsalted butter, 
            vegetable oil, 1 cup dark brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar 
            together in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer until light 
            and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time, beating well 
            after each addition, and scraping down the sides of the bowl as 
            needed. Beat mixture on medium-high speed for 4 to 5 additional 
            minutes after adding in the last egg. Mix in sour cream and 2 
            teaspoons vanilla extract. Pour in half of dry ingredients and mix 
            on low until just combined. Pour in cooled stout mixture and mix 
            until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients and mix until 
            just combined.Divide batter evenly between the 2 prepared cake pans. 
            Tap pans on the counter several times to remove any larger air 
            bubbles.Bake in the preheated oven and until the tops of the cakes 
            spring back lightly when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow cakes to 
            cool in pans for 20 to 30 minutes before removing to a wire rack to 
            cool completely, about 1 hour.Once cakes and frosting are both 
            cooled, place one cake layer on a serving platter. Top with about 
            1 cup frosting; spread it into an even layer. Top with remaining 
            cake. Pour remaining frosting over the top of the cake and smooth 
            over top and sides of cake until completely frosted on all sides.
